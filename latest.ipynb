    "# **Deep Research (DDG-Powered Agentic Pipeline)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a **small but complete agentic research pipeline** that plans web searches, gathers **high-signal snippets** via DuckDuckGo, and synthesizes a **long-form report** with inline citations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It also includes:\n",
    "- A **Gradio UI** for interactive use.\n",
    "- An optional **SendGrid email step** to deliver the final report as HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 **How It Works (Bird’s-Eye View)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`PlannerAgent`** — Analyzes your topic and proposes exactly **HOW_MANY_SEARCHES** focused queries, with clear reasoning for each.\n",
    "2. **Search Agent (DuckDuckGo)** — Runs each query via a tool, producing compact summaries with a “Sources” list.\n",
    "3. **`WriterAgent`** — Combines mini-summaries into a long report with inline citations `[1]`, `[2]`, etc., and a matching `final_citations` list.\n",
    "4. **(Optional) Email Agent** — Sends the report in **nicely formatted HTML**.\n",
    "5. **Gradio UI** — Streams progress and allows downloading the final Markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **1. PlannerAgent — “What should I search?”**\n",
    "- Generates **3 targeted search phrases** to cover:\n",

    "  - Trends\n",
    "  - Data\n",
    "  - Breadth\n",
    "- Ensures maximum relevance and minimal overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Search Agent (DuckDuckGo) — “Get me credible snippets quickly.”**\n",
    "- Executes `ddg_search` **exactly once** per phrase.\n",
    "- Summarizes in a few paragraphs.\n",
    "- Appends a **small, credible Sources list**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. WriterAgent (Synthesizer) — “Turn everything into a coherent report.”**\n",
    "- Builds a **multi-section Markdown report** (target length: **3–6k words**).\n",
    "- Adds **inline citations** `[n]` that correspond to an **ordered final_citations** list.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Email Agent — “Send it.”**\n",
    "- Uses **SendGrid** to deliver the final HTML-formatted report directly to recipients.\n",

    "## 🎨 **User Experience**\n",
    "- **Interactive Gradio UI** to visualize progress.\n",
    "- Live streaming of agent outputs.\n",
    "- **Downloadable Markdown** for offline use.\n",
    "- Optional **email delivery** for easy sharing.\n"

       "**Keras**, now integrated as an official API into TensorFlow, is an abstraction layer that simplifies building and training deep learning models. Its user-friendly interface allows developers, particularly those new to AI, to prototype models quickly. Keras is focused on enabling fast experimentation and is widely appreciated for its straightforward documentation and ease of understanding. This makes Keras an ideal choice for those who prioritize development speed and simplicity without compromising on model performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another important framework is **Scikit-Learn**, which is specifically designed for classical machine learning algorithms. Scikit-Learn excels in pre-processing data, model selection, and evaluation, making it a go-to choice for data scientists working with standard analytical tasks rather than deep learning. Its performance is consistently validated across various benchmarks, providing accessible implementations of algorithms. This framework's efficiency and user-friendly features are vital for practitioners aiming to produce reliable models with less complexity.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Performance Metrics and Evaluation Criteria\n",
       "\n",
       "When evaluating AI frameworks, specific performance metrics and evaluation criteria are critical to define which framework suits a project best. Speed, scalability, and ease of deployment are primary metrics. **Speed** refers to the framework’s ability to process large datasets quickly, which is crucial for deep learning models that require extensive computations. Benchmarks often gauge how fast frameworks can train models and handle updates, contributing to their overall reliability.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Scalability** is another essential factor, particularly for applications requiring robust solutions that can adapt to growing data sizes and algorithmic complexity. TensorFlow, for instance, is designed to scale easily from a single device to distributed setups across multiple machines, which is beneficial for large organizations or massive datasets. **Ease of deployment** is also regarded highly; frameworks facilitating straightforward export to various environments (e.g., mobile, cloud) gain an edge in practical implementations.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Community support** and **documentation** also play a vital role in the evaluation process. An active community can provide resources, plugins, and troubleshooting experiences, augmenting the framework's capabilities. Detailed and accessible documentation encourages user empowerment, which is especially important for newcomers to AI development.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Emerging Trends and Comparative Insights\n",
       "\n",
       "As frameworks evolve, new trends are emerging. A relatively new concept is the integration of different frameworks and tools to unify the strengths of multiple libraries. This trend seeks to address specific shortfalls of one framework with the assets of another, encouraging a more modular approach to model development. Additionally, the rise of **AI agents**, which automate AI processes, represents another paradigm shift currently capturing attention. Platforms like LangChain and CrewAI are being discussed as effective environments for developing complex agents that harness the power of established frameworks, promoting greater efficiency in operations.\n",
       "\n",
       "Evaluating the effectiveness of these frameworks in 2023 leads to frequently updated benchmarks that inform developers on which tools remain competitive or are fast becoming industry standards. Reports and surveys, like those from Stack Overflow, highlight how developers perceive AI frameworks, examining their usage and preference trends within the community. For instance, a substantial proportion of developers reported a preference for frameworks that facilitate ease of use and effective support, emphasizing practical applications over theoretical robustness.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the landscape of AI frameworks as of 2023 illustrates a continuing evolution toward flexibility, user-centric design, and integration of various technologies. Selecting the right framework encompasses more than just performance rankings; it involves understanding the specific needs of a project, evaluating metrics that matter, and considering broader trends in AI technology.
